    "1. Go to the main page of this Github respository (<https://github.com/UCIDataScienceInitiative/SpaceTime>), click on \"*clone or download*\" in the top-right corner, and select \"*Download ZIP*\" to download the whole repository on your computer. Unzip the respository if your browser has not done it automatically.\n",

    "2. Download the latest version of Anaconda for your operating system: <https://www.continuum.io/downloads> and follow the instructions to install.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. *[R users only]* Note that Anaconda comes with the Python kernel, but if you are using R, you also need to install the R kernel. For this, go to command line and type\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda install -c r r-essentials\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *[Python users only]* **Python Package Requirements**: Most required packages such as numpy, pandas, scipy, and matplotlib come with the Anaconda installation. However, you also need the rpy2 and statsmodels packages. You can use the Conda install command in command-line (or the Anaconda prompt in Windows):\n",

    "6. Open Jupyter notebook: In command prompt or the Anaconda prompt in Windows, navigate to where you downloaded this repository and type in\n",
    "```\n",
    "jupyter notebook\n",
    "```\n",
    "This should open up Jupyter on your browser from the directory that you navigated to above. Go to either *R* or *Python* and open the morning notebook by clicking on it. \n",
    "The kernel of your notebook should load automatically but you can also switch between kernels by using the 'Kernel' $\\rightarrow$ 'Change kernel' from the top menu bar.\n"
