    "1. Go to the main page of this Github respository (<https://github.com/UCIDataScienceInitiative/SpaceTime>), click on \"*clone or download*\" in the top-right corner, and select \"*Download ZIP*\" to download the whole repository on your computer. Unzip the respository if your browser has not done it automatically.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. *[Python users only]* **Python Package Requirements**: Most required packages such as numpy, pandas, scipy, and matplotlib come with the Anaconda installation. However, you also need the rpy2 and statsmodels packages. You can use the Conda install command in command-line (or the Anaconda prompt in Windows):\n",
