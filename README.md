# Welcome!
This one-day workshop will introduce you to concepts from statistics that are most important for statistically analyzing spatial-temporal data. Motivated by datasets from the envrionmental sciences, we focus our study on two concepts: statistical autocorrelation and periodicity. The meaning of these terms will become clear as we work through the notebooks, but for now 

Software: R packages, call R from Python.

The schedule of the course is as follows:

### First Thing 
INSTALL Anaconda, packages
DOWNLOAD GitHub repo and be able to open the notebooks
COME EARLY (8:30) if you can't do this

### Morning (pre-break)
- Introduction to spatial-temporal statistics
- Hands-on simulation to understand statistical concepts

### Morning (post-break)
- Applied time series analysis
- Trend analysis, harmonic regression (for seasonality and other peiodicity), regression with covariates

### Afternoon
- Statistical model selection for time series
- Extension of time series ideas to spatial analysis
- Variogram functions
- Spatial interpolation (Krigeing)
- Spatial regression
- Model selection for spatial models

# GitHub Table of Contents

## /R/ and /Python/
These folders contain the Jupyter notebooks. The notebooks contain notes to complement the slide presentation, along with executable code to implement the analyses we discuss. This is also the place where you will extend the analyses in hands-on exercises. The ``R`` and ``Python`` folders are effectively mirror copies of another for the respective languages. 

## Data
1. Los Angeles ozone time series and covariates
2. Oregon climate station data
