# GitHub Table of Contents

## /R/ and /Python/

## /Models/

## /Scripts/



TO DO:
- Clickable table of contents for notes
- Stats notes in Python and R simultaneously? Maybe just list give .stan files as character string inside notes?
- Pre-workshop installation instructions - run a basic model?
